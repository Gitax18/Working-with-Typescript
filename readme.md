# Working with TypeScript

This repository contains my practice work with TypeScript. It includes notes, code examples, and projects that demonstrate the concepts and applications of TypeScript in real-world scenarios.

## About This Repository

This repository is designed to explore and understand the core and advanced features of TypeScript. It emphasizes building scalable and maintainable applications using strongly typed JavaScript.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories that focus on specific topics and concepts:

- **00-basics**: Introduction to TypeScript fundamentals, including basic types and configurations.
- **01-type-annotation**: Detailed exploration of type annotations and their applications.
- **02-functions-type-annotations**: Understanding type annotations in function definitions and calls.
- **03-typed-arrays**: Working with arrays in TypeScript, emphasizing type safety.
- **04-tuples**: Introduction to tuples and their usage in TypeScript.

Each directory contains:

- **Notes**: Summaries and explanations of key concepts.
- **Code Examples**: Practical code snippets demonstrating the discussed topics.
- **Exercises**: Solutions to exercises to reinforce learning.

## Tools and Technologies

- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for executing TypeScript code.
