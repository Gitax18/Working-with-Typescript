# Working with TypeScript

This repository contains my practice work with TypeScript. It includes notes, code examples, and projects that demonstrate the concepts and applications of TypeScript in real-world scenarios.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories that focus on specific topics and concepts:

- **00-basics**: Introduction to TypeScript fundamentals, including basic types and configurations.
- **01-type-annotation**: Detailed exploration of type annotations and their applications.
- **02-functions-type-annotations**: Understanding type annotations in function definitions and calls.
- **03-typed-arrays**: Working with arrays in TypeScript, emphasizing type safety.
- **04-tuples**: Introduction to tuples and their usage in TypeScript.
- **05-interfaces**: Introduction to working with interfaces.
- **06-classes**: Basic OOPs and inheritence concepts.
- **07-project-1**: A simple project built using vite, here I am working with fakerJS library to implement fake User and Company and marking both of their location on map.

Each directory contains:

- **Notes**: Summaries and explanations of key concepts.
- **Code Examples**: Practical code snippets demonstrating the discussed topics.
- **Exercises**: Solutions to exercises to reinforce learning.

## Tools and Technologies

- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for executing TypeScript code.
- **Git**: Version control system for tracking changes.

## Getting Started

To access and run the code in this repository:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gitax18/Working-with-Typescript.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to a specific directory (e.g., 00-basics)**:

   ```bash
   cd Working-with-Typescript/00-basics
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

      npm install
   ```

4. **Compile the TypeScript code**:
   ```bash
   npx tsx <filename>
   ```

## Learning Objectives

- Gain a solid understanding of TypeScript's core features.
- Learn to apply type annotations for variables, functions, and complex data structures.
